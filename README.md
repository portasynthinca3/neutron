## It's not working
Don't worry, it's most probably not your fault. As this is my personal project that I can test in my virtual machines and on a real laptop only, it has some compattibility issues, both ones I am aware and not aware of. Please join our Discord server (link is at the top of this document), contact me through Discord directly (`portasynthinca3#1746`), or e-mail me (`portasynthinca3@gmail.com`) and describe the problem you're experiencing, so I can try to solve it.
