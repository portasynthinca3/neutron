## Credits
Thanks to the [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) Arduino library for containing the VLW font file format documentation!
Also thanks to Sasha Kulichkov for testing this software.
## The purpose of the project
Neutron is the result of me trying to get into the low-level stuff.
This project is **not** intended to do some crazy stuff like replacing the giants like Windows, Linux and macOS. That's just not possible. However, it doesn't mean i don't have an end goal. **The end goal is to write a simple 64-bit UEFI-powered OS that can run 3rd party applications and its GUI system, while requiring as little disk space, RAM and processor resources as possible.** Oh, and also, I just want to have fun :)
## Requirements
In theory, it should work on any modern system. Here they are:
*   CPU: x86-64 architecture
*   System: UEFI class 2 or 3
*   RAM: 64 MB
